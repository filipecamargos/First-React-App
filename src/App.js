/*###################################################################
Everything below was done in as state hooks which we converted back
into class based 

import React, { useState} from 'react'; //Converted to hooks

//This is a react component
//Every react component render (HTML -> (EJX)) to the DOM
const app = props =>  {  //class App extends Component got converted into rooks

  //Call state to use it it will return an array with two elements
  const [personState, setPersonState] = useState({  
    //state only avaliable in a class where it extends Componets obs: There are hooks
    //States allow to use data in this case you can store things that you need to manipulate in this class
    //When state changes it leads React to update the DOM
    //state = {
    persons: [
        { name:"Bob", age:"30"},
        { name:"Luke", age:"33"},
        { name:"Mark", age:"37"},
      ],
    //}
  })

  //The onClick button will handle this funtion that change the names
  const switchNameHandler = () => {
    //Don't Change state directly: this.state.persons[0].name = "Bob Marley";
    //Setters allows you to overide the other state
    setPersonState({ //Set states will always overwrite the older state, so you have to make sure to copy the older stuff
      persons: [
      { name:"Bob Marley", age:"50"},
      { name:"Luke", age:"33"},
      { name:"Mark", age:"40"},
    ]}
    )
  }; 
  
  //Note: you can have multiples uses states so you can manager it ex:
  // const [addressState, setAdressState] = useState ('Some Dress')

  return (
